            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Shahid, I started coding in 2020 and my first coding language was python. 
                My coding journey started with the hard one, I guess. I have always had a great passion 
                and interest in coding, but life does not give you everything that you want. 
                This is why I ended up doing a bachelor's degree in Marketing in 2015. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Coding has always been fascinating to me, that you can write a block of code and it comes to
                life. You have the power to create anything from scratch.  You have the ability to make things move, 
                and give them life. I think there is nothing in this world that could be more 
                impressive than coding. There is nothing that code can not do. Everything that we
                see involves coding. It is an unparalleled force and a powerful tool.
             </p>

            <h2>About Game</h2>
            <p>
                'Guess the number'  is a game that I have created, where a number is generated randomly 
                between 1 and 20. The user is given five chances to guess the correct number within 
                thirty seconds. Each time the users clicks a number, a hint is provided. 
                This hint tells the user to either choose a higher, or a lower number. 
                This game has elements of both reasoning and luck.
            </p>
            <p>
                This game is intended for people of any age and I hope that everyone enjoys it. 
                Happy guessing everyone.
