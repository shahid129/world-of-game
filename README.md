## User Experience or User Interface
### First Time User.
As a first time user I want:
- The user to have a clear idea of the game.
- The game to function properly and game to be intuitive.
- The user can understand what the game is about just from the name of the game.
- The user to know the rules of the game.
- The user to be able to play the game on different types of device.

### As Return or Frequent User.
As a return or frequent user I want:
- To be able to play the game without much distraction on the game.
- To br able to click on the number button rather than typing.
- Know how much time I have left before the game ends.
- To know my last input number.

### As a Owner of The Game.
As a owner of the game, I want:
- The user to be able to play the game on various device.
- The user knows how to play the game just from the main screen.
- Engage the user by limiting their time per game.

## Design
I tried to keep the design of the game as simple as possible. Keeping a great contrast between the background and the foreground was my main aim. Default brown color is used throughout all the pages against the white and light brown backgrounds.
The colors used are as follows:
- [Black](/assets/docs/black.png) is used for fonts  
- [Brown](assets/docs/brown.png) is used for buttons and footer 
-  [Green](assets/docs/green.png) is used for hover on name input
-  [White](assets/docs/white.png) is used for text color on top of brown
-  [White Smoke](assets/docs/white-smoke.png) is used as background on the main page and button background

## Font
I used Cormorant Garamond font throughout the page and as a fallback option I used San-Serif. The reason for choosing this font is that it stands out well enough against the background give it a clean and nice look.

## Features
<details>
<summary>Navigation menu </summary>

[Navigation menu](/assets/docs/navigation.png)
 is just on the top right of the corner. On a smaller device the menu turns into a [burger menu](/assets/docs/burger-menu.png). Help was taken to make the burger menu from a youtube video. After putting a lot of efforts and thought on how to code the burger menu, I came up with a way to code it. It worked well enough but there was a glitch in the code. That was the time I took help from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flItyHiDm7E)

<summary>Main Game Page</summary>

[The main game page ](/assets/docs/main-page.png)
is very simple, where the user is asked for their name. If no input is given, the Let's Play button remains inactive. The game rules are added on the main page as well, so the user does not need to go to any other pages to find out about the game.

<summary>Second Game Page</summary>
